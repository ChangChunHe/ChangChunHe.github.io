# Pyvaspflow

针对VASP软件的计算，我开发了一个全自动计算结构性质的Python程序包``pyvaspflow``,由于计算材料的物理化学性质都是有一套完好的流程的，所以我们是可以将其规范化成一个标准的工作流 (workflow) 来进行计算，并在结束以后生成数据库以便结果的分析与讨论。首先介绍一下高通量计算平台的基本架构，基本分成图2-1的四个部分。首先通过用户选择需要计算的项目，例如能带结构计算、态密度计算等，接着网页端把计算的流程编码成机器的指令发送到服务器上提交计算，然后等待计算完毕就可以将生成的数据库返回到网页端可以查询的地方，从而用户可以方便地对数据库进行查询并进行后续的结果分析讨论。具体可以参见``pyvaspflow``的文档，[https://pyvaspflow.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/](https://pyvaspflow.readthedocs.io/zh-cn/latest/)。

# RWmisc

[![R build status](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc/actions)
[![CRAN_Status_Badge](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/RWmisc)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc)

I've collected convenience functions that I've written to address issues I frequently confront in my work into a personal R package called [RWmisc](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RWmisc). It includes functions for:

- Managing multiple different projections for cross-national spatial data
- Converting latitude-longitude data in archaic forms (degrees, minutes, seconds)
- Correcting for overlapping polygons when aggregating raster data to polygons
- My custom minimal ggplot2 theme



To install the latest release on CRAN:

```r
install.packages("RWmisc")
```

The latest [development version](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/RWmisc) on GitHub can be installed with:

```r
library(remotes)
install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

# Other resources

I also have a number of other software resources focused on making computation and academic life easier:

- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/JobMarket) I use for my academic job market materials
    - Fill in school/position information in one file and it populates to all statements
    - Generate summary statistics from teaching evaluations and integrate into statements
    - Combine multiple teaching evaluations into a single portfolio document
    - Do all of this programmatically with GNU Make!
- [The template](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/UNC-Dissertation-Template) I used for my dissertation
    - This satisfied the formatting requirements at UNC in 2019
    - Some tweaking likely required to use at another institution or in the future
- [Scripts](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/Teaching) that I use to save time on various teaching-related tasks like grading
- [Functions](https://github.com/jayrobwilliams/ComputerVision) for extracting still frames from videos and information from images in Python using OpenCV
- [Compiling OpenCV](/files/html/OpenCV_Install.html) from source for Anaconda virtual environments instead of Homebrew ones or system Python installations
